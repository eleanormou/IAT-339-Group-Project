    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Can I edit my order?</h3>
<p>We can edit your order as long as it has not yet been processed or packaged. Keep in mind that orders may be processed earlier than expected on our website so we recommend that you let us know about any changes as soon as possible. We’re not able to add items to an existing order. If you’d like to add more items, place a new order and provide us with both order numbers; our team will merge them before shipping and reimburse any shipping fees, if eligible.</p>
    <h3>Can I edit my shipping address?
</h3>
<p>If your order has not yet shipped, email us at contact@jeu.com with the new address and order number and we can adjust it for you. If the order has already been processed and shipped, we’re not able to adjust the address for you but you can follow the instructions below for the appropriate courier! 

You can reach out to DHL directly by calling 1-(855)-345-7447 and providing the tracking number or online, here. 

If your order was shipped with FedEx, visit this link. 

If your order was shipped with Canada Post, please email contact@jeu.com as a claim must be opened.</p>

    <h3>Can I edit the engraving on my order?</h3>
<p>Once submitted, we’re not able to edit the engraving on your order. This is because they are processed by our engraver right away. Please be sure to review your order and engraving prior to placing your order. If you want to make sure you entered an engraving, it will appear on your order confirmation email sent after the order is placed and in your Mejuri profile under “My Orders”.</p>
    <h3>Can I cancel my order?
</h3>
<p>To cancel an order, email us at contact@jeu.com and our team will cancel and refund the original method of payment for you. Keep in mind that we’re not able to cancel orders that include engraved items since they are already processed. Be sure to check out the Engagement FAQ's for more details on canceling an engagement ring or wedding band.</p>
    <h3>How can I find my ring size?
</h3>
<p>To find your best fit, check out our sizing page, here, and follow the instructions. If you’re a half size, it's best to order the next size up. For example, if you’re between 6 and 7, go with a 7. 

If you need a hand determining your best fit, don’t hesitate to email us at contact@jeu.com.</p>
    <h3>Can I include a gift receipt?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Simply add your request along with any special notes you’d like included in your order in the gift message field at checkout. Our team will include a gift receipt in the package.</p>
    <h3>Can I combine discounts?</h3>
<p>A limit of one (1) discount may be applied to each order. If a second discount code is applied, our system will automatically select the better deal and the other discount will not be applied. Discount codes cannot be used in conjunction with free shipping discount codes, referral credit, referral codes or any other type of discounts. Mejuri has the right to hold and or cancel orders that use more than one discount code.</p>
    <h3>Can I work with you?</h3>
<p>We do things differently and hire people who have the same mindset. We’re growing quickly and love hearing from inspired people. If you’re interested in what we do and want to join, check our open positions, here or email us at contact@jeu.com.</p>
